                    <Accordion.Body>
                        ReactJS Router is mainly used for developing Single Page Web Applications. React Router is used to define multiple routes in the application. When a user types a specific URL into the browser, and if this URL path matches any 'route' inside the router file, the user will be redirected to that particular route.

                    <Accordion.Body>
                        The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders. It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated. It can be used to access a DOM element directly.
